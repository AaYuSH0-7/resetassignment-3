Requisition System: Application of Software Design Principles
During the development of the Requisition System, I used many basic software design concepts to write code that should be simple, flexible, and easier to maintain. The Open/Closed Principle, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS), and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) were the fundamental principles of the system. They made it easy to arrange the code in a way that was easy to read, modify, and add to, and they also contributed to the establishment of a strong foundation for the system architecture.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) was one of the principles utilized to develop the Requisition System. SRP contends that there must be a single responsibility of a function or class also that code could be easily comprehensible and maintained. In the Requisition System, there is a single function for a single task. For example, the staff_info() function has a single responsibility of retrieving staff information, e.g., staff ID and name. Similarly, the requisitions_details() function manages the input items and calculates the cost. In each function being responsible for only one task, the code remains clean, neat, and easy to handle. One can easily change one aspect of the system without disturbing the rest due to this structure design,
The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is of the opinion that things need to be kept simple. By making the code minimal, the users can engage with it better and the developers can get it more easily. In Requisition System, it was done the way the approval system was functioning. The process of approval is simple: if less than $500, approve requisition; greater than $500, put requisition on hold. This principle makes it easy to keep the system as simple as possible and unnecessary complexity is avoided. The menu system is straightforward with straightforward options for users to proceed with. This type of design prevents users from obtaining confusing and conflicting operations and makes the system simple to use.zz.
Avoiding code duplication is the goal of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) thought. Code becomes more efficient and easier to maintain when common logic is contained in reusable functions. In this case, input and computation of requisition items total are all handled by one function, requisitions_details(). Instead of repeating the same logic in multiple locations in the program, this function is called whenever new requisitions are entered. Similarly, display_requisitions() function has approval logic to display requisition data so that such a job isn't done again and again in the course of the program. The reusable functions avoid errors and are easier to modify later on.
Open/Closed Principle is all about caring about systems which need to be extensible without changing existing code. In Requisition System, this principle kicks in at the moment of approval. The degree of approval, currently defined in terms of a maximum allowable cost of $500, is easily extendible. If there are further approval rules, such as disallowing requisitions for more than a set amount, they can be added without altering the underlying structure. The system is extensible since new functionality can be added as and when required without compromising the initial structure. This renders the system more flexible for future requirements.
Using these principles, the Requisition System is efficient and robust. Using SRP, every function is responsible to one task alone, so the system becomes easier to understand and uphold. KISS makes the system easy and simple. DRY reduces redundancy, and therefore the code is more efficient and easier to support. Finally, the Open/Closed Principle ensures that the system is able to change to meet future requirements without affecting its primary function. Overall, these principles help in creating a system that not only functions but also remains flexible, maintainable, and future-proof.
On the whole, application of these design rules of software made development, maintenance, and extension easy for the Requisition System. In keeping with simplicity, avoiding redundancy, and design flexibility, the system is simple, easy to use, and modifiable as required. Following these rules, a system was developed that not only is operationally efficient in its current state but also robust enough to be extended or modified someday without copying the existing code.
